Hi there !

My name is Bastien Huber. I am an engineering student from the
Ecole Centrale de Lille, France.

I am passionate about Information Technologies, but often quite critical
on the way they are used. Therefore, I want to commit myself to projects
that will actually use them in an ethical way : that is to say, that will
not sell their users information, spy on them, or that will try to find
psychological tricks to make them check their smartphone every 2 minutes.

In 2017, I launched [MatchMyProject](https://matchmyproject.com), a platform
that helps student finding partners for their projects. For now, it is only
available in a few schools in France, but do not hesitate to contact me if you
want to join the network !

I also love cooking (mostly pastries), watching movies or TV shows, running,
dancing, playing board games, reading menswear blog, and performing on a stage.

After my friends and I had a bit of fun with the similarities between my last
name and the company "Uber", which has become an adjective I am sick of hearing
everywhere, I decided to buy the domain name `huberisation.fr`, and turn it
into a personal website. Hope you find it useful !
