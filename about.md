Hi there !

My name is Bastien Huber. I am young engineer who just graduated from the
Ecole Centrale de Lille, France.

I am passionate about Information Technologies, but often quite critical
on the way they are used. Therefore, I want to commit myself to projects
that will actually use them in an ethical way : that is to say, that will
not sell their users information, spy on them, or that will try to find
psychological tricks to make them check their smartphone every 2 minutes.

In early 2018, I launched [Treviz](https://treviz.xyz), a platform that helps
organizations become more open and collaborative. All the code is open sourced
GitLab; do not hesitate to contact me if you want to use it or collaborate!

I also love cooking (mostly pastries and vegan stuff), watching movies or TV shows,
running, dancing, listening to Pink Floyd, playing board and video games, reading menswear
blog, performing on a stage...

After my friends and I had a bit of fun with the similarities between my last
name and the company "Uber", which has become an adjective I am sick of hearing
everywhere, I decided to buy the domain name `huberisation.eu`, and turn it
into a personal website. Hope you find it useful !
