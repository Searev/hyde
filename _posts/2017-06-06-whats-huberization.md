title: What is Huberization ?
---

In 2016, everybody had a word on their lips: uberization. This expression, made
up from the name of what will probably be the biggest start'up to go bankrupt
around 2018, even made an entrance in some dictionaries.

The French dictionary "Le Petit Robert" defined it as follow:

> "Déstabiliser et transformer avec un modèle économique innovant
> tirant parti des nouvelles technologies."

Which, if you do not speak this glorious language that is French, broadly
translates as:

> "Destabilize and transform with an innovative business model
> that takes advantage from the new technologies."

Which, if you do not speak this glorious language that is corporate bullshit,
broadly translates as:

> "Fuck poor people and old industries by making slavery great again,
> because it runs on your smartphone."

Of course, the success of companies like Uber cannot just be accounted for their
dubious business model, built over the hard work of contractors who hardly make
a living out of it. I have to grant them with some credit for achieving nicely
designed applications that take fully advantage of the modern technologies, and
for disrupting fields of activities that rested for too long on a monopoly which
turned into an excuse for their mediocrity.

My name is Bastien Huber. I am a student in a French Engineering School, and
co-founder of [MatchMyProject](https://matchmyproject.com), a platform that
helps students finding partners for their projects. In this website, I will try
to explore new services, technologies and business models, see how they are
built, and share with you how they can be used in various projects.
