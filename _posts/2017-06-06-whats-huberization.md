title: What is (H)uberization ?
---

In 2016, everybody had a word on their lips: uberization. This expression, made
up from the name of what will probably be the biggest start'up to go bankrupt
around 2018, even made an entrance in some dictionaries.

The French dictionary "Le Petit Robert" defined it as follow:

> "Déstabiliser et transformer avec un modèle économique innovant
> tirant parti des nouvelles technologies."

Which, if you do not speak this glorious language that is French, broadly
translates as:

> "Destabilize and transform with an innovative business model
> that takes advantage from the new technologies."

Which, if you do not speak this glorious language that is corporate bullshit,
broadly translates as:

> "Fuck poor people and old industries by making slavery great again,
> because it runs on your smartphone."

Of course, the success of companies like Uber cannot just be accounted for their
dubious business model, built over the hard work of contractors who hardly make
a living out of it. They also have succeeded because they were able to build,
quickly, brilliantly designed apps that were able to disrupt fields of activities
that rested for too long on their monopoly.

Because we now live in a world where a couple of students can build, over
the course of a weekend, in their dorm room, a service that may go viral and be
used by millions, we have to stay tuned to the newest technologies and business
models. And that does not just mean hearing about the technologies with
[the highest hype according to Gartner](http://blogs.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartners-top-10-strategic-technology-trends-for-2015/). It means being able to *actually understand* how these technologies work,
and how they can *actually make sense* and be used in real-life applications.

This is the mission I modestly will try to achieve in this blog. Every now and
then, I will explore new technologies that seem promising, see how they are
built and how we can use them in various projects. If I have the courage, I might
even try to start some, in which case you would be welcome to contribute :)

**TL;DR:** This is a blog about how we can use modern technologies to build
actual and useful stuff.
